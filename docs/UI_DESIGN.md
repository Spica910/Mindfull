# Mindfull UI Design Overview

This document outlines a high-level plan for designing a simple and comforting user interface for Mindfull. The goal is to provide an environment where users who are feeling emotionally distressed can feel at ease while using the app. The estimated budget for the design and initial implementation is approximately **20 million KRW**.

## Design Goals
- **Simplicity:** Keep screens uncluttered and easy to navigate.
- **Calm Visuals:** Use a soft color palette (e.g., pastel blues, greens, or earth tones) and gentle gradients to reduce visual stress.
- **Readable Typography:** Choose rounded, humanistic fonts that convey warmth and are easy to read. Keep font sizes large enough for comfortable viewing.
- **Minimal Animation:** Use subtle transitions or fading effects to avoid overstimulation.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure elements have sufficient contrast and support screen-reader friendly labels.
- **Positive Messaging:** Provide encouraging language throughout the app (e.g., in guided meditation prompts and settings descriptions).

## Key Screens
1. **Home / Meditation Screen**
   - Central start/stop button with a calming icon (e.g., play/pause or a simple breathing symbol).
   - Timer and guide text placed prominently but with ample whitespace.
   - Background imagery or soft color gradient that does not distract from the text.

2. **Settings**
   - Simple layout with options for language, meditation duration, and audio preferences.
   - Include a brief description of how each setting can help with relaxation.

3. **Onboarding / Tips**
   - Short introduction screens with visuals that reinforce calm breathing or mindful moments.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to begin and what to expect during a session.

## Psychological Considerations
- **Color Psychology:** Cool colors such as blues and greens tend to evoke tranquility. Avoid harsh reds or overly bright colors.
- **Spacing and Layout:** Generous margins and whitespace help reduce cognitive load.
- **Imagery:** Use simple illustrations or muted photographs that convey nature or peaceful scenes.
- **Sound Design:** Soft sounds or gentle chimes for start/stop cues. Avoid abrupt or high-pitched tones.
- **Consistency:** Keep navigation and button placement predictable to provide a sense of stability.

## Budget Breakdown (approx.)
- **Visual Design and Wireframes:** 5M KRW
- **Graphic Assets and Icons:** 3M KRW
- **Prototyping and User Testing:** 4M KRW
- **Implementation Support for Developers:** 6M KRW
- **Contingency / Miscellaneous:** 2M KRW

The budget allocation is flexible and can be adjusted as needed. Investing in user testing is crucial to ensure the interface truly feels comforting for the target audience.

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed wireframes incorporating the guidelines above.
2. Conduct a small user study (remote or in-person) with participants who experience stress or anxiety to gather feedback.
3. Iterate on the design based on feedback and implement the UI in the Android app.
